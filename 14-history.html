        <h1>A Brief History of Me Making This Website</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;9:00am - Alarm goes off, and I am tired enought that I don't remember snoozing it the first three times.</li>
            <li>10:00am - Thinking I'm probably not making a website today. Work is kinda crazy and I'm leaving town in two days.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;6:00pm - I look at the theme for the day, think about a few ideas, none of them seem that interesting</li>
            <li>&nbsp;9:00pm - One idea I like, a history of my video game playing pulled from Steam API data</li>
            <li>&nbsp;9:05pm - Steam API doesn't have play session history data. Resign myself to not making a website today</li>
            <li>10:00pm - Look through other people's sites, bounce some ideas around with Nobel</li>
            <li>10:14pm - Come up with this dumb idea</li>
            <li>10:15pm - Begin typing this dumb idea</li>
            <li>10:20pm - Type this line</li>
            <li>10:21pm - Save, git commit, publish!</li>
            <li>10:21pm - (almost forgot to update the index)</li>
            <li>10:23pm - add non-breaking spaces to make the formatting line up</li>
        </ul>
